# TODO

- Manage secrets with [sops-nix](https://github.com/Mic92/sops-nix)
- Finish setup of [Cachix](https://cachix.org) binary cache. Or maybe switch to a [self-hosted](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic) one
- Configurations for full remote access with [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/)/[Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) (requires secrets set-up)
- System customization
- Write a good README
- Keep extending all the configs.
